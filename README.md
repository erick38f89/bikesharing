# Overview of the project

  There are important considerations to take into account while planning and presenting the project to bring a Bikesharing initiative to Des Moines, IA. Using the information obtained from the sample month of August 2019 we could observe important notations to share and make a case for the project.

# Bikesharing nature

  The idea of bike sharing is one that has been proven effective in large cities in the United States, not a small city itself, Des Moines may not be the most popular destination in the mid west, but the local office driven young professionals population could be a good nest for this initiative. Looking at the example of New Yor city may be a far fetch, but we can get signifficant information that even with lower volumes can tell us a lot about how the Bikesharing services are used.
